			<div class="review">
			<p>Upon arriving, I immediately recognized the place. I had visited a few times before when my father performed with his jazz band. The attached carwash at The Cove was a familiar sight. The Big Red was perfectly crispy, just as it should be. They have a wooden jungle gym for children to play on while you enjoy your meal. The murals on the walls outside further emphasize its local roots.<br><br>

I ordered the Texas Burger. It looked appealing and had good flavor, but it was just a small patty with a thin layer of beans on top. Everything is served à la carte, and I found the portion sizes to be quite small for the price. My friend Marina had the regular cheeseburger, and judging by her expression, she wasn't very impressed. I then tried the vegan loaded fries, which were smothered in a sauce with Mexican seasonings. While the appearance was unappetizing, the taste was decent, with the sauce providing good flavor and the tempeh adding a nice texture.<br><br>

Overall, the quality of the food is good, but the prices are somewhat high. It might not be the best place to bring a large family if you're on a budget. Our total came to just over $50 for two burgers, loaded fries, and a regular fry. This spot might be better suited for a visit with your significant other when you're in the mood for a decent burger and some live music.</p>

			Upon arriving, I immediately noticed the "hole in the wall" ambiance. The decor is simple, with basic wall adornments, including a framed picture of Guy Fieri from his visit some time ago. The menu is quite entertaining, featuring items such as "Kung Pao Guardian of the Palace," described as "fried chicken's nutty and spicy distant cousin." I ordered the "Twice as Nice Huh Guo Rou" with chicken fried rice, while Chelsea opted for the Kung Pao.<br><br>

The pork belly was pan-seared and delicious, perfectly paired with greens, bell peppers, onions, and chunks of tomatoes. It wasn't too salty and had what I imagine to be an authentic Sichuan flavor.

The fried chicken dumplings were crunchy and had a bit of flavor, though the accompanying sauce, which tasted like a mix of toasted sesame oil and hot oil, wasn't to my preference as I usually prefer sweet sauces with my dumplings.<br><br>

The chicken fried rice was just okay. It had a somewhat bland flavor, and the rice was a bit too dry for my liking.

The Kung Pao was interesting. It was lightly breaded but not crispy, with red peppers adding a nice kick. The blend of spices was decent, though the sauce seemed somewhat light.<br><br>

Overall, I'd say it's a decent place to eat. Prices range from $15 to $20 per plate, which is a bit pricey for a "hole in the wall" in my opion. However, I'll definitely be back with an appetite for more.

			<p>Upon my arrival, I was immediately greeted at the door and seated promptly. I was served a portion of crispy, hot chips that were fresh and flavorful. The salsa was packed with flavor and had a nice kick. The sweet tea tasted as if it was brewed by the gods themselves. One of the highlights of this place is the fresh tortillas they make in-house, served as an appetizer with unlimited refills. It's definitely not the place to be if you're watching your waistline.<br><br>

I ordered the Chicken Laredo, which consisted of a chicken breast topped with melted Monterey cheese, served with rice and borracho beans. The beans were delicious, with a hint of spice that added great flavor. The chicken Laredo was good, with a nice char from the grill that I enjoyed. It was topped with a creamy sauce and cheese, making it quite tasty. The rice was a bit dry but still had some flavor, though it wasn't the best rice I've had.<br><br>

The carne guisada plate came with refried beans that were okay—not too salty, though they could have been mashed better. The carne guisada itself was decent, tender, and served in a flavorful sauce, although the sauce's flavor was slightly different from what I'm used to.<br><br>

Overall, the food was well-made and tasted good. For the price, I'd say it was reasonable. While it may not meet all expectations for traditional Mexican food, it certainly has a Tex-Mex flair. When it comes to good Tex-Mex, Alamo Cafe certainly Mexi-Can deliver.</p>
